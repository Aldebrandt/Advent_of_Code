# Advent_of_Code
This is a repository for my solutions from the Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com

Have a look after you solved them yourself or if you are just curious how I went at it in Python.

I have coded it in Python with the PyCharm IDE and Python3.10.
If you clone the repository you have to add an Interpreter yourself before running it.


Feel free commenting my code and feel free to leave a suggestion and comment or two.
